                Iâ€™ve been working for a few years but have never worked in
                consulting before. Is there scope to join Connell Consulting as
                an experienced hire?

              <Accordion.Body>
                Most of our experienced hires have had some previous experience
                within strategy consulting. We do however accept applications
                for Analyst roles from people who have no directly relevant
                consulting experience.
